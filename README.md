# Create-C-VB.Net-Class-and-MS-SQL-Stored-Proc-Generator-from-MS-SQL-Database

I originally submitted this project on Planet Source Code. But since then Microsoft also broke their SQL Web Browsing 
service that allowed this program (and others) to be able to search for any SQL engines that were runnning on the PC.

I used to have a splash screen activate durin gthat process with this program but have stopped that.
Feel free to fork this to suit your needs or improve it. I got the table and most of the conversions needed to apply the correct data
types to work between the classes and the store procs from someone else as noted in the source code.

I have that info in a table in a separate database, which must be loaded into the SQL engine that has the database /table you are targeting to 
create a class / stored proc for.

Probably be best to set that table up in a XML file. and have this generator program use that.
